This script turns [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com /), [IMDB](http://www.themoviedb.org /), [Kinopoisk](https://www.kinopoisk.ru /) and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com /) to free online cinemas.
A checkbox will appear in the upper-left corner of each movie or TV series page. Clicking on it will open the movie player.
You can also now search for the desired content using the built-in search engine [Type Operator](https://tapeop.dev /) thanks to an unofficial script update.

## Installation ðŸŽ“

1. Install one of the extensions for running custom scripts:

    - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) _(recommended)_
    - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
    - [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
    - [Userscripts](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts)

2. Enable [developer mode in your browser](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=ru#Q209).

3. Install the script by going to [this link](https://github.com/Kirlovon/Tape-Operator/raw/main/userscript/tape-operator.user.js). _(or download `tape-operator.user.js` from folder `userscript`) and install manually)_

Done, now open a page with a movie _([example](https://letterboxd.com/film/babylon-2022/))_ and click on the flag in the upper left corner!

> If the flag doesn't appear, check if the script is installed correctly and restart your browser.

## Deploy ðŸš€

In case the link to the player is blocked in your country, you can deploy your own version of the site!

> This instruction is intended for developers and other users with the necessary technical skills.

1. Publish the static site located in the `player` folder of this repository.

    - Files and the `index.html` page should be accessible at the main address. _(http://example.com/index.html or simply http://example.com)_
    - Remove the analytics script located in the header of the `index.html` file to avoid sending anonymous analytics.

2. Edit the script from the `userscript` folder:

    - Replace the `PLAYER_URL` variable with the link to your site.
    - Add a line with the link to your site in the `@match` header. This is necessary for the browser to execute the script on your player page.
    - Remove the `@updateURL` and `@downloadURL` headers from the file so that the script doesn't try to update itself.
    - Make sure that the version in the `@version` header is equal to or not lower than the version specified in the `config.js` file, in the `REQUIRED_VERSION` variable. Otherwise, there will be a notification about an outdated script on the site.

3. Install the edited script.

> Self-hosting doesn't guarantee 100% site functionality, as [Kinobox API](https://kinobox.tv/) is used to obtain sources, which is currently impossible to deploy independently.
